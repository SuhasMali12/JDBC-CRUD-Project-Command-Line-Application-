# JDBC CRUD Project (Command Line Application)

## About Me
I am about to complete my **Java Full Stack course at QSpiders**.  
During this journey, I have gained knowledge of:  
- Core Java  
- Java 8 Features  
- JDBC  
- Hibernate ORM  
- Servlet & JSP  
- Spring Core concepts  
- Spring MVC  
- (Currently learning) Spring Boot  

To strengthen my understanding, I developed some **mini projects**. This is my **first JDBC project** which is a simple **Command Line Application**.

If you want to **suggest improvements**, please feel free to comment.  
If you are interested in **collaborating**, connect with me and let‚Äôs build more projects together üöÄ

## Project Overview
This is a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application** built using **JDBC in Java**.  
The project runs in the **command line interface (CLI)** where the user can perform database operations interactively.  

The project contains the following main files:  
- `Main.java` ‚Üí Entry point of the application.  
- `Driver.java` ‚Üí Implements logic to perform CRUD operations.  
- `ControllerInterface.java` ‚Üí Interface to define CRUD operations.

## Features
- Add new records to the database  
- View existing records  
- Update existing data  
- Delete records  
- Interactive menu-driven command line interface  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Java** (Core Java, JDBC API)  
- **MySQL** (Database)  
- **Maven** (Dependency management)  
- **JDBC Driver** (Connector for Java & MySQL)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-link>
   ```
2. Open the project in any IDE (Eclipse/IntelliJ/VS Code) with Maven support.  
3. Update the database connection details in the code (`Driver.java` or respective config file).  
4. Create the required database and tables in MySQL.  
5. Run the `Main.java` file.  
6. Follow the CLI menu to perform CRUD operations.

## Example Menu Flow
When you run the program, you will see a menu like:  
```
1. Add Record  
2. View Records  
3. Update Record  
4. Delete Record
